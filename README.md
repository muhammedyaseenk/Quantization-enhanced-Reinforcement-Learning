Thanks for sharing the `README.md` content! It looks like a solid start for a technical project—especially for something as advanced as **Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning (QeRL)**. Here’s a quick evaluation, and then a cleaned-up, professional version you can optionally use or build from.

---

### 🔍 High-Level Feedback:

**What’s Good:**

* ✅ Clear explanation of what QeRL is.
* ✅ Uses visual illustrations (`.png` assets).
* ✅ Sections for features, benefits, and installation.
* ✅ Effective use of markdown formatting (headings, bullet points, code blocks).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Polish formatting and consistency** — e.g., avoid inconsistent use of colons in headings, and separate code/comments from descriptions cleanly.
2. **Clarify some terminology** — e.g., "GRPO" might be better explained unless it's widely known in your field.
3. **Organize Features into a table or bullet list properly** — right now, the "📚 Additional Resources" section is a bit messy.
4. **Proofread** — some minor grammar or phrasing tweaks will help professionalize it.
5. **Assets** — ensure the `assets/` folder and referenced images exist in your repo for those image links to work.

# Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning (QeRL)

**QeRL** is a Quantization-enhanced RL framework for large language models. It combines **NVFP4 quantization** with **LoRA**, introduces **Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN)** to boost exploration, accelerates rollouts by **1.5×**, and enables RL training of **32B models** on a **single 80GB GPU**—matching the performance of full fine-tuning on benchmarks like **GSM8K** and **MATH**.

## 🔧 Key Innovations

### 🧠 Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN)

Quantizing a model (e.g., reducing its precision) naturally introduces small, random noise. In Reinforcement Learning, this randomness increases entropy—encouraging exploration. QeRL controls this injected noise to balance exploration and exploitation during training.

### 📈 Performance Highlights

## 🚀 Installation

### ✅ Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with **NVFP4** support (e.g., **H100**, **B100**, **RTX 5090**)
- Linux OS
- 64 GB RAM

### 🔧 Environment Setup

Use Conda to manage the environment:

```bash
conda create -n qerl python=3.10
conda activate qerl
pip install -r requirements.txt

| Feature                               | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NVFP4 Quantization**                | NVIDIA's 4-bit format for memory-efficient, high-speed inference and training.            |
| **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**        | Lightweight fine-tuning technique that updates low-rank layers only.                      |
| **Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN)** | Injects controlled noise to improve RL exploration and reward optimization.               |
| **High Scalability**                  | Enables training of 32B parameter models on a single 80GB GPU, avoiding multi-GPU setups. |

### Final Tips:

- Add a license (`LICENSE`) and contributing guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) if you plan to open source this.
- Consider linking to demo notebooks, Hugging Face models, or Colab versions if available.
- Add badges (e.g., Python version, build status, license, etc.) at the top for a more polished look.

Let me know if you’d like help generating those badges or setting up the repo structure!
